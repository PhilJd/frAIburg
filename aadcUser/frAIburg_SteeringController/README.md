# Steering Controller 

- Expects as input a `tPoint` and outputs the `tFloat32` steering angle in *degree*.
- Uses a pure pursuit method

## To Do

- Add offset to move camera coordinate system to rear axis
- Insert Pure Pursuit Routine
- Make adaptive w.r.t. to curvature and expected vs. real deviance

## To Test

- creation of ADTF pins
- functionality of tPoint type
- output constant steering angle
