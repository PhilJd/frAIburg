Missing:
__________

- LaneChangeToClear: How to know when obstacle is passed?
  : Use US sensors or object ID
#
- Setup parcour + Cut out signs
#
- Figure out why parking failed in testevent
  : Event priority in state machine?
#
- Crossing detection: CrossingByLane method - where to implement?
  : Triggered by horiz. lane detection;
#  
- Making robust turns, using available lanes
  : checkout map for detected lanes; add global orientation to lanes
#
- IPM of basler and rear cam
#
- IPM for basler in separate filter (used by zebra + lane filter)
  : send scale values 
#
- getting markerDetector working with cropped Baslers
  : use distorted image vs. (undistorted + identity transform + undoing alpha scale)
#
- Why does EM filter toggle enabled/disable with obstacle in front?
  : 
#
- Jury comm., obstacle detected, missing signs, parking spots
#
- robust orientation est. of cars, persons
#
- Does state machine still speed up after stopping at Zebra?
#
- Remove park behaviour from state machine
#
- Pedestrians at crossing, zebra (orientation) in Statemachine
- Slow down when child detected
#

Untested:
_________

- ManeuverPlanner, testing out all state transitions
#
- ManeuverGoal + continuous replanning, does it work at all?
#
- LaneChange behaviour
#
- Parking with rear cam
  : does the camera always work? Conflicts between two lanedetection filters?
#
